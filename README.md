# Wooden Bluetooth speaker

Wooden Bluetooth speaker is a project I designed in Fusion 360 and showed off in this video. If you don't know, Fusion 360 is a powerful software in which you can create 2D and 3D objects, design PCBs, make mechanical simulations, and much more. I definitely recommend you learn about it because it will help you a lot at creating your DIY projects.

As I highlighted in the tutorial, the sound box is made from MDF pieces that were cutted off by a laser-cutting machine. The electronics behind is not complicated. There is a list below about every component I bought and how much they cost:

+ 2 - 5W 4ohm speakers - U$6 (2 * 6 = U$12)
+ 1 - Bluetooth audio receiver module - U$2
+ 4 - Li-ion battery cell - U$1.75 (4 * 1.75 = U$7)
+ 1 - Charging and protection module TP4056 - U$1
+ 1 - 2 positions switch - U$0.20
+ 1 - Bitumen Colors (brown coffee) - U$2
+ 1 - EVA foam sheet - U$0.50
+ 1 - Glue - U$1.25
+ 1 - MDF enclosure - U$4
Total: U$29.95

So for about 30 bucks you can also build a wooden Bluetooth speaker. I believe this project is worth its price because I learned a lot and created something I'll use for a long time. I hope the files available here and this video, in which I explain the step-by-step design and bulding processes, will help you create your own Bluetooth speakers.

Just to reminder you, the bluetooth-soundbox-3D.f3d file is about the 3D object created on Fusion 360. The bluetooth-soundbox-laser-cutting.dxf is the file you must upload to the laser cutting machine. It contains the 2D drawings of the Bluetooth speaker.
